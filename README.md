# MeyerCorp.Usps

A more convenient wrapper of the United States Postal Service APIs. 

The USPS Web APIs are an HTTP web service, however they rely on long strings of rudimentary XML as a parameter of the query in the target URL.

MeyerCorp.Usps uses a more traditional RESTful approach in most cases and exposes a Swagger endpoint.
