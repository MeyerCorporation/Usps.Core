# MeyerCorp.Usps

A more convenient wrapper of the United States Postal Service APIs. 

The USPS Web APIs are an HTTP web service, however they rely on long strings of rudimentary XML as a parameter of the query in the target URL.

MeyerCorp.Usps uses a more traditional RESTful approach in most cases and exposes a Swagger endpoint.

## Architecture

The solution contains four projects allowing two main configurations for use:

### API

This is a .NET Core Web API which allows the product to be configured and hosted like any .NET Core web app.

### USPS

This is a .NET Core library which contains the controller and model components. It will yield an assembly which is refrenced by the API project and also a NuGet package which allows the controller and models to be included in an existing web application.

### Client

This is a .NET Standard library which contains code generated by AutoRest based on the Swagger information presented by the API. This can be referenced as a project in a solution, but it also creates a NuGet package.

### Test

This is a collection of unit tests written in xunit.
